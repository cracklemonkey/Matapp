      <h3>A little bit about us</h3>
      <p>
        Kasti Ké stems from the idea to reduce and raise awareness about food
        waste. <br />
        This is a demo where we have set up the basic layout of the app. But it
        is still miles away from what it could be, this is just a little
        preview, but just imagine!
      </p>
      <p>
        The concept is to encourage people to reduce their food waste. How? You
        might wonder. Well by simply giving away food instead of throwing it.
        Easy Peasy!
      </p>

        Very often, we buy too much, or we buy things we, in the end, don’t use.
        <br />
        We all had that experience of looking at the fridge and being like “hmm
        this zucchini is soon going off, I need to eat it in the next two days..
        ah but pff I don’t really fancy eating this, or I actually don’t have
        the time to cook in the next few days”. <br />
        Let’s take another common situation: you are about to go away on holiday
        and it turns out you still have quite a few food items that you haven’t
        eaten. What will most likely happen? You’ll end up throwing that food
        away. And that’s just a shame.
      </p>
      <p>
        To that end we aim to offer a solution. Through our app, you can list
        out food items you are not going to use, and offer others, living in
        your neighborhood, the opportunity to pick them up. The same way if you
        find items you are interested in, you can also order them and pick them
        up.
